# Bugs
## change password
- Can't change password forth and back. Set a new password. Change back to the old one. Redo this. There seems to be some kind of problem.

# Suggestions
## cart
- a confirmation should be needed when deleting a line item (low prio)

## search
- no search should be triggered if the textfield is empty (e.g. just click the search icon twice)

## checkout
- credit card number breaks if there is one to select
- add order confirmation page
- add orderID in db

## other
- uppercase (conf->messages.properties)
- include tax's into calculation? if yes change order
