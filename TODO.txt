# Bugs
## addresses
- Create an address and delete it afterwards >> the confirmation dialog button says delete account this needs to be changed (exists for billing and shipping)
- Can't enter "ThÃ¼ringen" as a state for a german address. Maybe some kind of "Umlaut" regex problem. German addresses should be able to contain "Umlaute". Same problem for cities. (low prio)

## credit card
- Create a credit card delete it afterwards >> the confirmation dialog button says delete account this needs to be changed

## change password
- Can't change password forth and back. Set a new password. Change back to the old one. Redo this. There seems to be some kind of problem.

# Suggestions
##header
- the user icon should have different states for logged in/ logged out e.g. grey when logged out and blue when logged in.
- after loggin in successfully a confirmation message should be shown
- the name "Poster Store" should be in the vertical middle of the logo (e.g. add "vertical-align: middle;" to the class "titleShopText" in CSS)

## addresses
- there should be more distance between the different address types on the page
- adjust wording address should start with a capital letter in all headlines

## payment settings
- add a headline "Credit cards" instead of the horizontal line or remove this line, since it has no purpose

## change password
- remove the clear button since we don't have this at another place

## cart
- a confirmation should be needed when deleting a line item (low prio)

## search
- no search should be triggered if the textfield is empty (e.g. just click the search icon twice)

## checkout
- credit card number breaks if there is one to select
- credit card date if there is one to select: there should be a separator "/" between month and year
- credit card date on order placement page: there should be a separator "/" between month and year instead of "."
- add order confirmation page
- add orderID in db

## other
- uppercase (conf->messages.properties)
- include tax's into calculation? if yes change order
- Header, Footer auf die volle Breite ?
- pixel verschiebung im Menu bei mouse-hover
