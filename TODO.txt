# Bugs
#Products overview
- Every images has the same tooltip as the images of first site -> bs.paginator seems not to pass the title attribute correctly

# Suggestions
## cart
- a confirmation should be needed when deleting a line item (low prio)

## search
- no search should be triggered if the textfield is empty (e.g. just click the search icon twice)
- pagination does not work if the search result returns more than 6 products
- enter some text in the search input field, then change size of window -> different inputs -> search field of mobile and not mobile version does not get sync'd

## checkout
- credit card number breaks if there is one to select
- add order confirmation page
- add orderID in db

#payment settings
-edit button for credit cards

## other
- uppercase (conf->messages.properties)
- include tax's into calculation? if yes change order
- Header, Footer auf die volle Breite ?
- pixel verschiebung im Menu bei mouse-hover
